		Extra small devices - e.g. phones(< 768 px)
		Small devices - e.g. tablets(≥ 768 px)
		Medium devices - e.g. laptops(≥ 992 px)
		Large devices - e.g. desktops(≥ 1200 px)
		
		xs = works in extra small, small, medium and large sizes
		sm = works in small, medium and large sizes
		md = works in medium and large sizes
		lg = works in large sizes
		
		
		col-md-4 would indicate 4 columns for medium and large screens
		the component (usually div) works in medium and large size without change position. If the screen is small or extra small, the div wind up and the next
		one will go to the next row (carriage return)
		
		the class property can be override eg
		<div>
			<div class='col-xs-4 col-sm-6 col-md-4'>Content</div>
			<div class='col-xs-4 col-sm-6 col-md-4'>Content</div>
			<div class='col-xs-4 col-sm-6 col-md-4'>Content</div>
		</div>
		this mean: when is in extra small screen size compress the div. When in small screen size divide by 2 and in mediu size divide by 3 coluns
		if the number of the xs is 2
